# CS-210-Programming-Language


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  -Corner Grocer wanted rearrange their entire produce section. They wanted to create the most effective layout based on how often an item was purchase. So we create a menu from them that allows them to see an indiviudal product and the number of times it was bought. They have the option to recieve a list of each item and the number those items were bought. The next option is the same as the second, however, the information will be displayed in a histogram. Then finally the final option was to exit the program.

What did you do particularly well?
    -I felt like I just did alright on everything. I made a working program with no issues that myself nor my professor ran into. I did just barely good enough.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      - I know for visuals I could have made my menu a bit better perhaps add a border or something to organize the menu display a bit better. This could even the harder to see people. I felt that there was probably a better way to handle creating the menu to make it more efficicent. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  -I think the most challenging part to write is just the beginning and organizing everything to together. It is hard to start from scartch. I just overcame it by remembering everything I was thought and all the different examples of code I have seen while learning. I don't have any support network to add anything to yet. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  -I think that all the skills I learned will be transferable, this felt like a realy example of programming, having more experience in C++ is important to have for this field.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  -I felt like I use proper spacing and in-line comments. So anyone could easily find their way in the blocks of code and with the comments they can tell what that block was being used to do. I felt that really made my code more maintainabke,readable and adapatble.
